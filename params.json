My child and I are allergic to common\r\nhouse pets (cats && dogs). Wanted to have some sort of companion during those\r\nlong daily coding session.\r\n\r\nAlso, one of my co-founders @Nuuton is a robotics whiz. Some weeks ago she\r\nwas awarded in a big competition for her awesome hacking skills. I've been \r\ndying to build another robot since then. \r\nThis one is for you saviourofthelostcode.\r\n\r\n###What is LEDee?\r\n\r\nLEDee is a robotic friend. Right now, all it can do is blink an LED.\r\nIn future versions, he will be equipped with all (a lot!) of the sensors\r\nI've managed to collect along the years of building robots and hacking hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Pictures will be uploaded soon.\r\nRight now its just an arduino (sorry LEDee, you are more than an ardunio to me)\r\nwith an LED. Next week it should have more sensors on it. Will include\r\npictrues with that update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Build your own LEDee!\r\n\r\nI plan to add an ethernet shield to LEDee. This will allow it to \r\nconnect to the web. You will be able to see how LEDee is doing\r\nby visiting its (not yet built) page. You will also be\r\nable to build your own LEDee and talk with mine \r\nif you add an ethernet shield to yours. \r\nJust make sure you don't use the same name of my LEDee, because\r\nit could cause future potential problems. \r\nThis functionality is planned, but not yet developed. \r\n\r\nIf you build a LEDee, email me (orangethirty@nuuton.com) and tell me about it.\r\nI'd be happy to talk hacking with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n###How does LEDee work?\r\n\r\nCurrent version (V0.1) uses one red LED.\r\nIt has two modes of operation. It is either *up* or *sleeping*.\r\nThe main loop generates a random number.\r\nIf the random number falls whithin a given scope, \r\nthen a conditional decides if LEDee should be up or sleeping.\r\n\r\nEach operation is different.\r\n\r\nThe *up* operation makes the led blink fast for a random amount of time.\r\nThe random amount of time is the same number used to decide if LEDee should\r\nsleep or get up.\r\n\r\nThe *sleep* operation has a set maximum amount of time. We don't want LEDee to\r\nsleep too much and miss the fun.\r\n\r\nBoth operation operate whithin a LOOP to control the time they run.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Am I crazy?\r\n\r\nLet's flip a coin. In all seriousness, this is a real project. LEDee has a \r\nbunch of awesome uses. It helps me debug code by rubber ducking.\r\nKeeps me awesome silent company while in the office.\r\nMakes sure I eat lunch, \r\nbecause the red led allows me to (sort of) keep track of time.\r\n\r\n###Hardware\r\n\r\nArduino duemilanove328 (any arduino will work)\r\nAdafruit Protoshield (not really needed but nice to have) or a breadboard.\r\nOne LED (5mm).\r\nThe Arduino runtime (I used V1.0.1).\r\nOne USB cable.\r\nSome jumper wires.\r\n\r\n\r\n###About my LEdDee\r\n\r\nMy LEDee is called chunky.\r\nSports a fancy 5mm red LED.\r\nLoves to hang out next my Lenovo (it looks up to it).\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\n####License\r\n\r\nLEDee code is licensed under the GNU WTFPL.\r\n2012 orangethirty@nuuton.com\r\n","name":"Ledee","google":"","tagline":"LEDee my friend.
